What Is the DOM?
================

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a **programming interface** for HTML and XML documents. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects.

The Document Object Model (DOM) provides another way to represent, store and manipulate that same document. It is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page.
